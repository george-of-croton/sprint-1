Question 1:
Explaining the Command Line to a Normie
The command line is a different way of interacting with your computer. Your home computer uses what is called a "graphical user interface". Basically, what that means is the people who designed the software your computer runs on provided you a whole bunch of buttons that they think you would want to use. The thing is though, if they were to provide a button for every function your computer could perform there would be far too many buttons all over the place and it would be confusing.

The command line is different. Instead of choosing what you want your computer to do by clicking a button, you type what you want it to do into the command line. Unfortunately, computers do not speak english. So for example, you cannot just type "make me a sandwich" and the command lines spits out a sandwich. You have to learn to use "commands". 

Commands are usually abbreviations of their function. for example the command "ls" lists all the files in a folder and as you can see it's shortened form of the word list. That kinda makes sense, huh? There are lots of different commands and it takes a while to learn them all and 2016 so you better get on it!

Question 2
10 Terminal Commands
1. pwd - Print Working Directory -shows which folder you are currently chilling in.

2. ls - List - lists all the files chilling in that folder. like jpegs and stuff.

3. cd - Change Directory - This changes the folder you are looking at. For example, if you are tired of looking at your photos of grandma's 99th Birthday and you want to look at your photo's from her 98th birthday instead, this is the one to use.

4.mkdir - Make Directory - When it comes to making a new folder, you cannot overlook good old mkdir. 

5. cp - copy file - This one is great when you are feeling unoriginal. Take any old file and make another one the exact same then slap a new name on it.

6. mv - move file or folder - This may seem self explanatory, guys,  but please bear with me here. This command takes a file or folder from one place (i.e a folder) and puts it somewhere else (another folder probably).

7. rmdir - remove directory - This command will remove a diretory if you get sick and tired of putting up with its nonsense. The opposite of mkdir

8. rm - remove file - a lot like rmdir but for files. 

9. find - find files - This command is great when you can't remember where you saved a file. Just run this command with the name of the file you are missing and it will show you the directory it is hiding in.

10. exit - exit the shell - All good things must come to an end and command line sessions are no exception. Use this command when you are done and want to close the command line.
